Description: creditrISDA package contains the C code of ISDA Standard Model, which is 
             developed for evaluating credit default swaps (CDS). After Big Bang Protocol 
             came out in 2009 after the financial crysis, CDS trading is standardized and 
             ISDA Standard Model becomes a widely used approach to price CDS and measure risk 
             exposures of CDS. creditrISDA package contains the C code of the original 
             open-source ISDA Model, as well as the R wrapper to call ISDA Model with R 
             functions, using Rcpp. This package is intended to be a helper package for R 
             package creditr, which is available on CRAN.
