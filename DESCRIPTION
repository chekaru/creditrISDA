Description: creditr package provides useful tools for pricing credit
             default swaps (CDS). It enables CDS class object which has slots as
             name, contract, RED, date, spread, maturity, teno, coupon, recovery,
             currency, notional, principal, accrual, pd, price, upfront,
             spread.DV01, IR.DV01 and rec.risk.01, with S4 methods like update,
             show and summary. It also supports data frame input and is able to
             provide convenient calculation of key CDS statistics through functions
             like CS10, IR.DV01, rec.risk.01 and spread.DV01. Of other major
             functions, spread.to.upfront and upfront.to.spread are designed to
             compute one of spread and upfront given the other; spread.to.pd and
             pd.to.spread, similarly, can calculate one of spread and probability
             of default given the other; add.dates and add.conventions compute a
             series of dates information and accounting conventions related to CDS
             pricing. Finally, get.rates and build.rates facilitates direct
             fetching of relevant interest rates from online sources. Thanks to 
             ISDA Standard Model's Open Source license, we are able to create this
             package for R users. You can find the Open Source licence of ISDA
